**Token Discipline:** Keep this file short. Move details to `docs/`.

1. Read `AGENTS.md` first for the primary project context, commands, and rules.
2. Consult `docs/PROJECT.md` for scope, stack, layout, and constraints.
3. Consult `docs/CONVENTIONS.md` for style, naming, testing, and git workflow.
4. Log plans in `docs/TODO.md` and decisions in `docs/DECISIONS.md`.

**Startup:** If `docs/PROJECT.md` or `docs/CONVENTIONS.md` contain `TBD`, fill them concisely (facts-only) before starting other work.

Do not duplicate policy text here. Use this file purely as an index to the deeper context in `docs/`.
