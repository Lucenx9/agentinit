# Claude Router

**Token Discipline:** Keep this file short. Move details to `docs/`.

> **🚨 CORE MANDATES:**
>
> - **YOU MUST ALWAYS** read `docs/STATE.md`, `docs/TODO.md`, and `docs/DECISIONS.md` autonomously at the exact start of every session. Do not ask for permission.
> - **YOU MUST ALWAYS** update `docs/STATE.md` and `docs/TODO.md` autonomously before ending a task or session.
> - **YOU MUST ALWAYS** log new tools, dependencies, or conventions in `docs/DECISIONS.md`.

1. Read `AGENTS.md` first for the primary project context, commands, and rules.
2. Consult `docs/PROJECT.md` for scope, stack, layout, and constraints.
3. Consult `docs/CONVENTIONS.md` for style, naming, testing, and git workflow.
4. Log plans in `docs/TODO.md` and decisions in `docs/DECISIONS.md`.
5. Review `.claude/rules/` for coding style, testing, and repo layout guidelines.

**Startup:** If `docs/PROJECT.md` or `docs/CONVENTIONS.md` contain unfilled placeholders, fill them concisely (facts-only) before starting other work.

**Maintenance:** If you introduce or change commands, conventions, or decisions, update the corresponding docs in the same PR. Update `docs/STATE.md` only if priorities/next steps changed.

Do not duplicate policy text here. Use this file purely as an index to the deeper context in `docs/`.
