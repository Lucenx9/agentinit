# Gemini Router

**Token Discipline:** Keep this file short. Move details to `docs/`.

1. Read `AGENTS.md` first for the primary project context, commands, and rules.
2. Consult `docs/PROJECT.md` for scope, stack, layout, and constraints.
3. Consult `docs/CONVENTIONS.md` for style, naming, testing, and git workflow.
4. Log plans in `docs/TODO.md` and decisions in `docs/DECISIONS.md`.

**Resume:** At session start, read `docs/STATE.md`, `docs/TODO.md`, and `docs/DECISIONS.md` to pick up where the last session left off.

**Startup:** If `docs/PROJECT.md` or `docs/CONVENTIONS.md` contain `TBD`, fill them concisely (facts-only) before starting other work.

**Maintenance:** If you introduce or change commands, conventions, or decisions, update the corresponding docs in the same PR. Update `docs/STATE.md` only if priorities/next steps changed.

Do not duplicate policy text here. Use this file purely as an index to the deeper context in `docs/`.
