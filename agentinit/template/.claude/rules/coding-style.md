# Coding Style

- Follow the existing style in the codebase — match indentation, naming, and patterns.
- Prefer clarity over cleverness; write code a new team member can read.
- Keep functions short and focused on a single responsibility.
- Use descriptive names for variables and functions; avoid abbreviations.
- Add comments only where the intent is not obvious from the code itself.
- Avoid introducing new dependencies without documenting the rationale.
- Prefer standard library solutions when they are sufficient.
- Run the project formatter and linter before committing.
