## Entry Format

- Date: YYYY-MM-DD
- Decision: Short statement
- Rationale: Why this choice was made
- Alternatives: Options considered and why they were not selected

## Dependencies Policy

- **Runtime deps:** prefer none unless an entry below explicitly approves one.
- **Dev deps:** allowed only if recorded as a decision entry below **and** reflected in `PROJECT.md` Commands.
