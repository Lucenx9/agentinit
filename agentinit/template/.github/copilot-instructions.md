# Copilot Instructions
Use `AGENTS.md` as the primary router and source of truth.
Then read `docs/PROJECT.md`, `docs/CONVENTIONS.md`, `docs/TODO.md`, and `docs/DECISIONS.md`.
Keep this file short; do not duplicate long guidance.

## Build/Test
- Build: TBD
- Test: TBD
- Lint/Format: TBD

Update `docs/TODO.md` and `docs/DECISIONS.md` as work progresses.
