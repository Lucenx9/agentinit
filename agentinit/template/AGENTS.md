# Agent Instructions (AGENTS.md)

**Purpose:** Primary entry point for coding agents to understand the project structure and rules.

**Non-obvious conventions / landmines:**

- (Add project-specific warnings, anti-patterns, or strict rules here)
- ...

**Commands:**

- Setup: TBD
- Build: TBD
- Test: TBD
- Lint/Format: TBD
- Run: TBD

**When unsure:**

- Ask for clarification / confirm assumptions before risky changes.
- Read the linked files in `docs/` for deeper context.

**Resume:** At session start, read `docs/STATE.md` + `docs/TODO.md` + `docs/DECISIONS.md`.

**Context files (load when relevant):**

- `docs/PROJECT.md` — Scope, stack, layout, constraints.
- `docs/CONVENTIONS.md` — Style, naming, testing, git workflow.
- `docs/TODO.md` — Active work, plans, assumptions.
- `docs/DECISIONS.md` — Past architectural choices and rationale.
- `docs/STATE.md` — Current focus, next steps, blockers (session handoff).

**Token discipline:**

- Keep this `AGENTS.md` file short (~60–120 lines).
- Move long explanations, architecture notes, and deep dives to `docs/`.
- Prefer linking to other files over inline dumps.
- Don't repeatedly re-read these files unless they changed.
