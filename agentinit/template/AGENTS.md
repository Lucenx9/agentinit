# Agent Router

This repository standardizes context/memory files for coding agents.
AGENTS.md is the source of truth; avoid copying policy text into other router files.

Read these first:

- docs/PROJECT.md
- docs/CONVENTIONS.md
- docs/TODO.md
- docs/DECISIONS.md

Commands (TBD):
- Setup: TBD
- Build: TBD
- Test: TBD
- Lint/Format: TBD
- Run: TBD

General rules:

1. Follow docs/* before making changes.
2. Keep plans, assumptions, and progress in docs/TODO.md.
3. Record durable choices in docs/DECISIONS.md.
4. Use docs/CONVENTIONS.md for style, naming, testing, and git workflow.
5. Update docs/PROJECT.md when scope, constraints, or layout changes.
6. Prefer minimal, reversible changes and note tradeoffs.
7. If guidance conflicts, AGENTS.md then docs/* in listed order wins.
8. If something is missing, update docs/* instead of adding more router text.
